A plugin allowing you to easily set all the WP-Syntax color settings in one place and configure WP-Syntax to fit your theme.

== Description ==

[WP-Syntax](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/ "WP-Syntax") is a fantastic WordPress plugin which automatically syntax-highlights source code in &lt;pre&gt; blocks for a large number of languages. Unfortunately, styling WP-Syntax's output can be a bit of a headache.

I have put together WP-Syntax Colorizer, a WordPress plugin that gathers all of the functions required to set custom colors for your code snippets, and it is simply run alongside WP-Syntax.

== Installation ==

This plugin, of course, requires WP-Syntax to be installed.

1. Upload `wp-syntax_colorizer.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Upload the modified `wp-syntax.css` into the root directory of your theme.
1. Edit the colors in `wp-syntax_colorizer.php` to fit your needs.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do all the `set_keyword_group_style` lines correspond to? =

The correspondence is language-dependent. For more information see the [GeSHi documentation](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/documentation.php "GeSHi documentation").
